# Standup meetings

DuckieCorp strives to be the kind of agile software shop that employs only the
most trendy software development methodologies.  One such methodology is called
"Scrum", in which teams hold a brief meeting on a daily basis to talk about how
their work is progressing.  Since our class doesn't meet every workday, we'll 
do standups at the beginning of each class period going forward.

It is important to stay on track as you enter the final stretch of each
assignment.  You don't have time to waste spinning your wheels on unproductive
tasks.  The stereotype in software development is that a 1 week project morphs
into a 2 week quagmire.  The gimmick behind the Scrum "stand up" meeting is to
notice this schedule slippage early and address it ASAP.

This is called a "stand up" meeting because it's supposed to be brief.
Out-of-shape programmers don't like to stand for more than a few minutes.
Each member of the team takes turns answering these questions:

0. What have you done since last scrum?
1. What will you do between now and the next scrum?
2. What got in your way of doing work? (impediments)


#### Impediment: Something that impedes; a hindrance or obstruction
> -- from The American Heritage(R) Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Ed

Of these three questions, the last is the magic one.  You will probably realize
your own solution by putting your impediments into words ("Restate the
Problem").  Failing that, it's quite likely that another member of your team
has encountered a similar problem and can offer good advice.
